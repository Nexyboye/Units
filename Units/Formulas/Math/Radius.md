definition
	A radius is a straight line or segment that connects the center of a circle or sphere to any point on its circumference or surface. It is also used to represent the length of this line segment, which is half the diameter of the circle or sphere. In other words, the radius is the distance from the center to the edge of a circular or spherical object.
