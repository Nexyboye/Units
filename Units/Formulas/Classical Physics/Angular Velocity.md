$$ω = \frac{Δθ}{Δt}$$

where
	θ = [[Angular Displacement]]
	t = [[Time Interval]]

definition
	Angular velocity is a measure of how quickly an object rotates around a specific axis or point in a given period of time. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (speed of rotation) and direction (axis of rotation). Angular velocity is typically represented by the symbol ω (omega) and is usually measured in units of radians per second or degrees per second.
