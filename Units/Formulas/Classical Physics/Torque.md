$$τ = I \cdot α$$

where
	I = [[Moment of Inertia]]
	α = [[Angular Acceleration]]

definition
	Torque is a measure of the force that causes an object to rotate around an axis, typically expressed in newton-meters (Nm) or pound-feet (lb-ft). It is a vector quantity that represents the rotational equivalent of linear force. In simpler terms, torque is the turning or twisting force that helps determine an object's rotational speed and acceleration.
