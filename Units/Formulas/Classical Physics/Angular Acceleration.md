$$α = \frac{Δω}{Δt}$$

where
	Δω = change in angular velocity
	Δt = time interval

definition
	Angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time. It represents how quickly an object's rotational speed is changing and is typically measured in radians per second squared (rad/s²).
