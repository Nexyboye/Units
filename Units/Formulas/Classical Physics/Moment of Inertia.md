$$I = m \cdot r^2$$

where
	m = [[Mass]] of the object
	r = [[Radius]] from the axis of rotation

definition
	Moment of Inertia, also known as the mass moment of inertia or rotational inertia, is a measure of an object's resistance to a change in its rotational motion. It is a property of a distribution of mass in space, which depends on both the mass and the shape of the object. In simple terms, the moment of inertia is a scalar value that quantifies how difficult it is to change an object's rotational motion about a specific axis or pivot point. Higher moments of inertia represent greater resistance to changes in rotational motion, while lower moments of inertia indicate less resistance.
