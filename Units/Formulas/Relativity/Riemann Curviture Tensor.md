$$R^a_{bcd} = ∂_c Γ^a_{bd} - ∂_d Γ^a_{bc} + Γ^a_{ce} Γ^e_{bd} - Γ^a_{de} Γ^e_{bc}$$
where
	$Γ^a_{bc}$ are the Christoffel symbols
	$∂_c$ and $∂_d$ are partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates $x^c$ and $x^d$, respectively.

definition
	The Riemann curvature tensor is a mathematical object used in differential geometry to describe the curvature of a manifold.
