$$R_{ij} = R^k_{ikj}$$

where
	$R^k_{ikj}$ are the components of the Riemann curvature tensor

$$R_{ij} = \frac{∂Γ^k_{ij}}{∂x^k} - \frac{∂Γ^k_{ik}}{∂x^j} + Γ^k_{ij}Γ^l_{kl} - Γ^k_{ik}Γ^l_{jl}$$
where
	$x^k$ and $x^j$ are the coordinates on the manifold

definition
	The Ricci tensor is a mathematical object used in differential geometry and general relativity that describes the curvature of a Riemannian manifold or a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. It is a rank-2 symmetric tensor derived from the more general Riemann curvature tensor, which captures the intrinsic curvature of a manifold.

help
	For example, if k ranges from 1 to 3, then the expression $R^k_{ikj}$ would be equal to $R_{i1j} + R_{i2j} + R_{i3j}$.
