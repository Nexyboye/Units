$$G_{μν} + Λ \cdot g_{μν} = \frac{8 \cdot π \cdot G}{c^4} \cdot T_{μν}$$

where
	Gμν = Einstein tensor, which represents the curvature of spacetime.
	gμν = metric tensor, which describes the geometry of spacetime.
	Tμν = stress-energy tensor, which contains information about the distribution of matter and energy.
	Λ = cosmological constant, which represents a uniform energy density of the vacuum.
	G = gravitational constant, which determines the strength of gravity.
	c = speed of light in a vacuum.
