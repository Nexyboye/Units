$$G_{μν} + Λ \cdot g_{μν} = \frac{8 \cdot π \cdot G}{c^4} \cdot T_{μν}$$

Where:
- Gμν is the Einstein tensor, which represents the curvature of spacetime.
- gμν is the metric tensor, which describes the geometry of spacetime.
- Λ is the cosmological constant, which represents a uniform energy density of the vacuum.
- Tμν is the stress-energy tensor, which contains information about the distribution of matter and energy.
- G is the gravitational constant, which determines the strength of gravity.
- c is the speed of light in a vacuum.
